Gral - Graphics Accelerator Library

What is gral
============
Gral is a very thin wrapper over another hardware accelerated rendering API (e.g OpenGL, Ogre3D, etc.).
It allows the cairo backend for gral (cairo-gral) to be rendering API agnostic.
Any rendering API that gral targets can accelerate cairo graphics through the cairo-gral backend.
